This article refers to the [Control Theory tutorial written by S. Simrock](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1100534/files/p73.pdf) from DESY, Hamburg, Germany.

Control system is a system that in minimal consists of the **plant**, the **sensor**, and the **compensator**. The plant is the part to be controlled. The sensor measures the variable or signal of the plant. The measured value from sensor then compared to the input from system to get the error value. The compensator a.k.a controller amplifies and filters the error to manipulate the input to the plant. The input to the plant may vary, for example it can be in form of mechanical forces or electrical forces.

Those components configured in a **closed-loop system**. The closed-loop system is a system that sends input to the plant, in which the input value determined by certain system output a.k.a responses. The closed-loop configuration in control system is called **feedback systems**. Two types of feedback systems are **regulator** and **servo mechanism**. Regulator system maintains a physical variable at some constant value in the presence of perturbances. Servo mechanism drive a physical variable to track some desired time function value.

Three examples of the feedback systems are RF control systems, Passive network circuit, and Operational amplifier circuit.
